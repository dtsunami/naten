# da_code Development Roadmap & Implementation Status

## Phase 1: Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETED
### Enhanced Agent Context & File Operations
- ‚úÖ **Smart Directory Context**: Activity-based subdirectory previews with temporal intelligence
- ‚úÖ **Activity Scoring**: `max(avg_file_activity, directory_activity)` formula for relevance
- ‚úÖ **Integrated Temporal Listing**: Files and directories show modification time deltas
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced file_tool**: Added `list` operation with emoji file types and recursive depth
- ‚úÖ **MCP Integration**: Dynamic MCP server loading with Agno framework
- ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture**: Agno-only implementation, removed LangChain dependencies

### Key Files Enhanced:
- `agno_cli.py` - Enhanced directory context with temporal intelligence
- `agno_agent.py` - MCP integration and system prompt improvements
- `agno_tools.py` - Added file_tool list operation with smart filtering
- Architecture migrated from LangChain to pure Agno framework

## Phase 2: Workflow Automation Engine üéØ NEXT PRIORITY

### The Vision: Wiki-Driven Automation
**Core Concept**: Transform existing deployment wikis/runbooks into executable agent workflows

```
Wiki/Runbook + Agent + MCP Servers = Automated Workflows
```

### User Experience Target:
```
You: "Run the Q4 deployment process"

Agent reads: "Deployment_Process_Q4.md"
- ‚úÖ Step 1: Create JIRA ticket DEPLOY-XXX
- ‚úÖ Step 2: Run `npm run build:prod`
- ‚úÖ Step 3: Upload artifacts to S3
- ‚è∏Ô∏è  Step 4: **HUMAN NEEDED** - Get security approval
  üìß Email sent: "Security approval needed"
- ‚úÖ Step 5-21: Continue after human input...
```

### Technical Implementation:

#### 1. Workflow Execution Engine
```python
class WorkflowExecutor:
    def execute_runbook(self, wiki_path):
        steps = self.parse_wiki(wiki_path)
        for step in steps:
            if step.needs_human:
                yield HumanInputRequired(step)
                await self.wait_for_human_input()
            else:
                result = self.execute_step(step)
                yield StepCompleted(step, result)
```

#### 2. Enhanced Wiki Format
```markdown
## Step 1: Create Deployment Ticket
- **Action**: `jira.create_ticket`
- **Project**: DEPLOY
- **Summary**: Q4 Production Deployment {{DATE}}

## Step 2: Security Approval ‚ö†Ô∏è HUMAN REQUIRED
- **Action**: `human_input`
- **Contact**: @john-security on Slack
- **Notification**: Email + Slack DM
```

#### 3. Chrome MCP Server (CRITICAL)
- **Web automation** with user's existing browser sessions
- **Form completion**: GitHub issues, deployment dashboards, admin panels
- **Multi-site workflows**: Coordinate actions across multiple web applications
- **Auth piggyback**: Use existing logins, no token management

### Implementation Roadmap:

#### Phase 2A: Chrome MCP Integration (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Integrate mcp-chrome server (https://github.com/hangwin/mcp-chrome)
- [ ] Test web automation with user sessions
- [ ] Build form completion capabilities
- [ ] Create multi-tab orchestration

#### Phase 2B: Workflow Parser (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Wiki/markdown parser for executable steps
- [ ] Step classification (automatable vs human-required)
- [ ] Natural language to MCP tool mapping
- [ ] Context preservation between steps

#### Phase 2C: Human-in-the-Loop (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] Multi-channel notification system (email, Slack, desktop)
- [ ] Workflow state preservation during interruptions
- [ ] Resume mechanisms with full context
- [ ] Progress tracking and reporting

#### Phase 2D: Integration & Testing (2-3 weeks)
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Documentation and examples

### Key MCP Servers Needed:
1. **Chrome/Browser MCP** ‚≠ê PRIORITY - Web automation
2. **Slack/Teams MCP** - Communication and notifications
3. **Jira/Linear MCP** - Issue tracking and project management
4. **GitHub/GitLab MCP** - Code repository operations
5. **AWS/GCP MCP** - Cloud resource management
6. **Docker/K8s MCP** - Container and deployment management

## Phase 3: Long-Term Vision üöÄ

### Multi-Project Intelligence
- Cross-repository awareness and dependency mapping
- Workspace-wide search and replace
- Multi-repo deployment orchestration
- Architecture decision tracking

### Autonomous Development Capabilities
- Self-healing code suggestions
- Predictive performance monitoring
- Intelligent test generation and optimization
- Proactive issue detection and resolution

### Collaboration & Knowledge Management
- Team coordination and work distribution
- Real-time development feedback
- Documentation that stays current
- Knowledge graph of project decisions

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Solid Foundation Built:
- **Smart Agent Context**: Temporal directory intelligence with activity scoring
- **Extensible Architecture**: MCP integration for unlimited tool expansion
- **Enhanced File Operations**: Intelligent directory navigation and file management
- **Clean Codebase**: Modern Agno framework implementation

### üéØ Next Critical Path:
1. **Chrome MCP Integration** - Enable web automation with user sessions
2. **Workflow Engine** - Parse and execute wiki-based runbooks
3. **Human-in-the-Loop** - Smart notifications and workflow resumption

### üí° Key Success Metrics:
- **Eliminate context-switching overhead** in developer workflows
- **Automate 80% of deployment/admin tasks** while preserving human oversight
- **Reduce onboarding time** from days to hours via executable runbooks
- **Scale tribal knowledge** through executable documentation

The foundation is rock-solid. Chrome MCP + workflow automation will be transformational! üî•
